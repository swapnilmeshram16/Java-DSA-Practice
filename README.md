Java DSA Practice
This repository contains my Java-based solutions for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, practiced for placement preparation.
The solutions are organized topic-wise for better understanding and quick reference.

Topics Covered
Arrays: Reverse array, find max/min, move zeros, rotations, missing numbers, frequency count, Kadaneâ€™s algorithm, etc.

Strings: Palindrome check, reverse words, character frequency, anagrams, etc.

Sorting: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, etc.

Linked List: Insertion, deletion, reversal, cycle detection, etc.

Other Problems: Basic number theory, pattern printing, recursion problems, etc.
